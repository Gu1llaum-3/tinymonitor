# Zensical allows you to override specific blocks, partials, or whole
# templates as well as to define your own templates. To do this, uncomment
# the custom_dir setting below and set it to a directory in which you
# keep your template overrides.

# With the "favicon" option you can set your own image to use as the icon

# Zensical supports more than 60 different languages. This means that the
# labels and tooltips that Zensical's templates produce are translated.
# The "language" option allows you to set the language used. This language

# and guide search engines and translation tools.

    # If you have many content tabs that have the same titles (e.g., "Python",
